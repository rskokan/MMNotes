About MM Notes
==============
MM Notes is an iPhone and iPad application that allows you to easily take notes, mark them with tags and attach photographs to them.

iCloud backup and synchronization
=================================
MM Notes uses Apple's iCloud to backup all your data. Furthermore, if you have more iOS devices such as the iPhone and iPad, thanks to iCloud your notes will be synchronized across all your devices.
Just make a note at home on your iPad to check the cars to buy, then when visiting a car show attach a few photos to the note and later go through it again on your iPad. As an Apple device owner you have all the iCloud services for free.
